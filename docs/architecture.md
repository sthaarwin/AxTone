# AxTone System Architecture

## Overview
This document describes the overall architecture of the AxTone system, including its major components and how they interact.

## Components
- Audio Processor
- Tab Generator
- Model Training Pipeline
- User Interface

## Data Flow
1. Audio input is processed by the Audio Processor
2. Processed audio is analyzed by the Tab Generator
3. Results are presented to the user through the User Interface

## Technical Stack
- Python 3.8+
- Audio processing libraries (librosa, etc.)
- Machine learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow)

## Future Improvements
